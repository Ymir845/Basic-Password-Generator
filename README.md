**THIS DOESN'T WORK WELL, ACTUALLY IT ALMOST DOESN'T WORK AT ALL**

The first C++ 'Project' (if you could call it one) that I decided to take on. Made on the exact same day I picked up the language, at the moment it's unfinished.
 - Missing a list of numbers
 - Missing a list of special characters
 + It does generate letters, which is pretty sick
